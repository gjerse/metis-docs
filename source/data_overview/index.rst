### Data Structure and Levels

Understanding the data structure is key to beginning your analysis. Metis data adheres to the Solar Orbiter standard, distributed across various processing levels.

* **Level 0 (Raw Data):** Uncalibrated telemetry data. Not typically used for scientific analysis.
* **Level 1 (Calibrated Data):** Calibrated and converted to physical units. This is the **recommended starting point** for most standard scientific analysis.
* **Level 2 (Derived Data):** High-level scientific products and processed images (e.g., density maps).
* **Level 3 (Community Data):** Products generated by the scientific community.

### Key Analysis Workflows

Use the resources below to navigate your analysis path, from data acquisition to final results.

* **Data Access and Download** (:doc:`data_access`)
    This page provides clear instructions and **Python code snippets** for the programmatic download of Metis data from the official SOAR archive using the SunPy FIDO client.

* **Python Analysis Functions** (:doc:`analysis_tools`)
    An overview of the core functionality within the **``metis-tools`` Python package**. Learn about the primary data loader (e.g., ``metis_load()``) and the functions available for visualization and processing, all built to be compatible with the SunPy ecosystem.

* **Integration of Legacy IDL Tools** (:doc:`idl_tools`)
    A crucial guide detailing when and how to utilize **legacy IDL routines**. It explains the method for safely importing IDL output files (``.sav``) into the Python environment for final analysis and publication-ready plotting, minimizing interruptions to your Python workflow.
